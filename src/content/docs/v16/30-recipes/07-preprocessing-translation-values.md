By default, translation values are added "as-is". You can configure a `compiler` that
implements `TranslateCompiler` to pre-process translation values when they are
added (either manually or by a loader). A compiler has the following methods:

* `compile(value: string, lang: string): string | Function`: Compiles a string to a function or another string.
* `compileTranslations(translations: any, lang: string): any`:  Compiles a (possibly nested) object of translation values to a structurally identical object of compiled translation values.

Using a compiler opens the door for powerful pre-processing of translation values.
As long as the compiler outputs a compatible interpolation string or an interpolation
function, arbitrary input syntax can be supported.
