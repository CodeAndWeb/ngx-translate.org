## Intro: Why ngx-translate is the Best Localization Library for Angular

ngx-translate stands out as the best localization library for Angular due to its flexibility and runtime language-switching capabilities, allowing developers to switch languages dynamically without reloading the entire application.

### Key Advantages

* **Runtime Language Switching**
  ngx-translate enables seamless switching of languages at runtime. The application automatically updates all text elements, making the user experience more fluid.

* **Small Deployment Size**
  Only the necessary language files are loaded from the server. Additional features, if needed, can be added as plugins, keeping the deployment lightweight.

* **Highly Flexible**
  The module is designed to be [modular](/v15/reference/concepts) and easily extensible, allowing for better adaptability in various project setups.

* **Plugins for Additional Features**
  Enhance ngx-translate with plugins, including support for ICU-formatted messages, making it suitable for advanced use cases.

* **Translation ID Extraction**
  Effortlessly extract translation IDs from both your code and templates, simplifying the localization workflow.

* **Powerful Tool Support**
  Tools provide comprehensive support for ngx-translate, allowing you to easily manage and edit translation files across multiple languages in a
  user-friendly interface, streamlining the translation process.
