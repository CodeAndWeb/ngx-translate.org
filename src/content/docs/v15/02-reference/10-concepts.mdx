ngx-translate offers several customizable classes, making it highly adaptable
to virtually any localization requirement.

* [**TranslateModule**](/v15/reference/translate-module-api/)
  The core module for configuring ngx-translate. It allows you to set up basic
  configuration and specify which classes to override from the default
  implementation.

* [**TranslateService**](/v15/reference/translate-service-api/)
  The central service: It provides the API for interacting with your
  application, enabling you to load translations, switch languages, and
  retrieve translated messages.

* [**TranslateLoader**](/v15/reference/translate-loader-api/)
  Handles the loading of translation files. It can either statically import translation data into the app
  or dynamically fetch it from a server, based on your configuration. Multiple loaders are available as plugins.
  The default loader, for example, retrieves JSON-formatted translation files from the assets folder at runtime.
  It is also possible to load other file formats such as .po files.

* **TranslationPipe** and **TranslationDirective**
  These allow you to use translated texts directly within your templates. Both automatically
  update the UI when the language is switched at runtime.

* [**MissingTranslationHandler**](/v15/reference/missing-translation-handler-api/)
  By default, if a translation ID is missing, ngx-translate serves the translation from the default language,
  or if unavailable, returns the ID itself. The MissingTranslationHandler allows you to customize this behavior,
  providing flexibility in how missing translations are handled.

* [**TranslateCompiler**](/v15/reference/translate-compiler-api/)
  The compiler pre-processes translations after loading, allowing for
  performance-intensive operations to be executed once per message. The results
  are then cached for efficiency. It is commonly used to handle tasks like
  compiling ICU-formatted messages for advanced localization scenarios.

* [**TranslateParser**](/v15/reference/translate-parser-api/)
  Injects parameters into translation strings, allowing dynamic content such as
  usernames in greetings or other variable elements in your messages. This is
  called each time a translation message is requested and should only perform
  lightweight operations. The default implementation simply replaces all
  strings in `{{...}}` with the matching provided parameter.
