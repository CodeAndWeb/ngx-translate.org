## Supported Versions

We support only the most recent **major version** of ngx-translate.

- **Currently supported**: Version **17**
- **Unsupported**: All versions prior to 17

To benefit from the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates, we strongly recommend that you use the latest version.

## Using Older Versions

If you're using a version older than v17, consider the following options:

- **Upgrade to the latest version**
This is the recommended path. Each release includes a migration guide to help you transition from the previous version. If you're using a much older version, you may need to upgrade incrementally.

- **Use commercial security patches**
If an upgrade isn’t immediately possible, commercial providers can supply security patches and compatibility fixes for older versions.

- **Continue using an older version without support**
This is not recommended. Running unsupported versions without security updates poses risks and may lead to compatibility issues.
