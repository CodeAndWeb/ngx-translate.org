## Supported Versions

We support only the most recent **major version** of ngx-translate.

| Angular       | @ngx-translate/core | @ngx-translate/http-loader | Tutorial |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |--- |
| 16 - 20+ | 17.x | 17.x | [Tutorial](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit/tutorials/how-to-translate-your-angular-app-with-ngx-translate/) |

## Older versions

When using an EOL (End Of Lifetime) version, you have a few options:

- **Upgrade**<br/>
  Upgrade to the current version of Ngx-translate. We have worked hard to make upgrading simple. You can view our migration guide to assist you in your upgrade.

- **Remain Out of Date**<br/>
  Continue using the outdated version, but be aware that you will be subject to security risks and bugs. This is not recommended!

- **Commercial Support for EOL versions**<br/>
  Our partner [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-angular?utm_source=ngx-translate&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=angular_support_link&utm_id=NgxTranslateReferral) offers commercial security support for EOL versions of Ngx-translate.
  If you cannot migrate but must remain secure you can contact them [here](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-angular?utm_source=ngx-translate&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=angular_support_link&utm_id=NgxTranslateReferral).

You can choose the version that corresponds to your Angular version. We do not support
or update older versions anymore.
