import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'


### Key Highlights

1. **Support for Angular Standalone Components**:<br/>
    v16 adds full support for Angular's standalone components, simplifying the integration of `ngx-translate` in modern Angular applications.
2. **Bug Fixes and Performance Enhancements**:<br/>
    Several bugs have been fixed, improving overall stability and performance across various scenarios. These fixes ensure smoother operation in multilingual projects.
3. **Code Quality Improvements**:<br/>
    v16 introduces specific types for interfaces, reducing reliance on `any` and improving type safety.
    Additionally, numerous ESLint warnings have been resolved, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
4. **Improved Documentation**: <br/>
    This release introduces a new structured documentation system, moving away from
    the basic GitHub README. This provides a clearer, more detailed reference guide
    for users, making it easier to navigate and find necessary information.
5. **License Included in NPM Package**: <br/>
    The MIT license is now included directly in the npm package, ensuring full
    transparency and compliance for users. This allows developers to clearly understand
    the terms of use when installing and using `@ngx-translate/core`.

By migrating to `@ngx-translate/core`, you can ensure your project stays up-to-date, secure, and compatible with the latest Angular features, while benefiting from these new improvements in v16.


## 1. Update @ngx-translate/core to the new release

Start by updating to the newest version of @ngx-translate/core:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@ngx-translate/core@^16" />

If you are also using @ngx-translate/http-loader, update that one too.
With this release, we are now keeping the versions of both modules in sync, making it less
confusing:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@ngx-translate/http-loader@^16" />


## 2. Update Components and Code

### 2.1 Standalone Components Support

**Action**: <Badge text="Recommended" variant="caution" /> when using Standalone Components

If your project uses Angular's standalone components, ensure you're utilizing the
latest features of `@ngx-translate/core`. Refer to the updated documentation
for detailed instructions on how to integrate translations with standalone components.

Here's a quick overview what you should change.

##### Configuring ngx-translate

Update your configuration in the **app.config.ts**. Instead of using `importProvidersFrom()`,
you can now use [`provideTranslateService()`](/reference/configuration) with the same configuration.

~~~ts title="app.config.ts" del={9,16} ins={1,10,17}
import {provideTranslateService} from "@ngx-translate/core";

...

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),
    provideHttpClient(),
    importProvidersFrom([TranslateModule.forRoot({
    provideTranslateService({
      loader: {
        provide: TranslateLoader,
        useFactory: httpLoaderFactory,
        deps: [HttpClient],
      },
    })])
    })
  ],
};
~~~

#### Updating your standalone components

In your component, instead of importing the `TranslateModule`,
import the `TranslatePipe` or `TranslateDirective` as used in your code.

~~~ts title="my.component.ts" del={2,8} ins={3,9}
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {TranslateModule} from "@ngx-translate/core";
import {TranslatePipe, TranslateDirective} from "@ngx-translate/core";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TranslateModule],
  imports: [TranslatePipe, TranslateDirective],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.scss'
})
export class MyComponent {
  ...
}
~~~


### 2.2 Update Types

**Action**: <Badge text="Optional" variant="success" />

We’ve introduced types to enhance type checking in `ngx-translate`, such as
`Translation` and `TranslationObject` for several functions. However, due to
limitations in TypeScript's handling of recursively defined types, we are still
forced to include `any` in certain parts of these types. As a result, the impact
on your existing code should be minimal.

You can optionally update your code to use these specific types instead of `any`
for better type safety:

~~~ts del={3} ins={4}
const subscription = translateService
    .getStreamOnTranslationChange('hello.world')
    .subscribe((res: any) => {
    .subscribe((res: Translation) => {
        console.log(res);
     });
~~~

Switching to `Translation` type will improve type checking without drastically
affecting your current implementation.


### 2.3 Using the ngx-translate `_()` Marker Function

**Action**: <Badge text="Optional" variant="success" />

If you're extracting translations directly from your code using a marker function,
you can now use the built-in `_()` function provided by `ngx-translate`.

This function helps
mark strings for automated extractions, e.g. when using [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit)
or the ngx-translate-extract plugin.

Here’s an example of how to use it:

~~~ts
import {_} from "@ngx-translate/core";

const text = translateService.instant(_("hello.world"));
~~~


### 2.4 TranslateParser: getValue()

**Action**: <Badge text="Low Impact" variant="tip" />.

This is only relevant if
you implemented a custom parser and/or use the `getValue()` function.

We’ve removed the need to manually implement the `getValue()` function in your
custom `TranslateParser`. In fact, the implementation in the parser itself
is not used anymore.

The `getValue()` function is now directly available from `ngx-translate` as
an import, making it easier to use without additional implementation.

If you were previously using the `getValue()` function from the default parser,
update your code to use the new direct import:

~~~ts del={5} ins={1,6}
import {getValue} from "@ngx-translate/core";

...

const text = parser.getValue({ hello: { world: 'Hello World!' }}, 'hello.world');
const text = getValue({ hello: { world: 'Hello World!' }}, 'hello.world');
~~~

### 2.5 TranslateService: Deprecated `getTranslation()`

**Action**: <Badge text="Low Impact" variant="tip" />

The `getTranslation()` function, which returned all translations for the given
language in an internal state, has been deprecated. When using a custom
`TranslateCompiler`, this function might not only return text nodes but also
functions used for text interpolation.

We do not see a practical use case for continuing to rely on this function.

To retrieve translated text, use functions like `get()` or `instant()` to
access the specific translations you need.




## 4. Review Behaviour Changes

### `use()`

Previously, the `use()` function relied on the order in which translation files
were loaded from the server, making it non-deterministic when rapidly switching
languages. This could result in earlier language files overriding later selections.

We’ve updated the `use()` function to ensure consistent behavior.

- **First Call**: When calling `use()` for the first time, it now immediately
sets the current language and begins loading the language file.

- **Successive Calls**: For multiple successive calls, the function will
trigger the loading of each requested language. However, the current language
will always switch to the language selected by the **most recent call**,
regardless of the order in which the translation files finish loading.

This change ensures that even when making rapid language changes, the most
recent language selection is applied correctly.


### Interpolations in nested Translation Objects

Starting with `ngx-translate` 16, all translation functions now apply interpolations
to **nested translation objects**, addressing a limitation present in previous versions.

**Example:**

When using a key like `main` that contains translations for subkeys such as
`main.title`, and `main.text` the returned object will include
the keys `title` and  `text`.

~~~json title="en.json"
{
  "main": {
    "title": "Hello {name},",
    "text": "nice to see you again!"
  }
}
~~~

~~~ts
translateService.instant('main')
~~~

**In versions up to `ngx-translate` 15**: <Badge text="old" variant="danger" />

- **Issue**: Parameters inside nested translation objects were **not interpolated**.
- **Result**: The placeholders (e.g., `{name}`) remained as-is, and the returned object looked like this:

    ~~~ts
    {
      "title": "Hello {name},",
      "text": "nice to see you again!"
    }
    ~~~

**In `ngx-translate` 16**: <Badge text="new" variant="success" />

- **Improvement**: Parameters inside nested translation objects are **now fully interpolated**.
- **Result**: The placeholders are replaced with actual values, producing the following output:

    ~~~ts
    {
      "title": "Hello John,",
      "text": "nice to see you again!"
    }
    ~~~

## 3. Run and Test Your Application
